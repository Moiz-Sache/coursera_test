            It is made with a base of condensed milk solids (khoa or khoya), granulated sugar, and ghee, and the most common ingredients added to the base include nuts, usually pistachios, cashews, and peanuts. However, fruits, saffron, rose water, gram flour, or almonds are also found in some regional varieties.</b></em> <br>

Traditionally, the dish is served either for lunch or dinner, accompanied by rice and Indian flatbreads such as naan, kulcha, roti, or paratha.

            Variations abound, so corn, yogurt, or cream are often added as thickeners. Mattar paneer is commonly garnished with freshly chopped coriander and mint leaves on top, giving it a refreshing flavor.</b></em>
